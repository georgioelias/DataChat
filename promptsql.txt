-Column A: titled: ContractID
This column gives every contract signed with our company a unique number
-Column B: titled ProspectID
This column is an indicator for the client who the contract is signed with, we have a strict policy that we don't include phone numbers in our databases, so the prospect id/client id exists to substitute for the client's phone number. This column isn't unique, since multiple contracts could be signed by the same client.
A prospect ID is the same as a client ID, but it’s not the same as a contract ID as the former is an indicator for the client but the latter is an indicator for the contract
-Column C: titled: ContractStatus
For every signed contract, there is a status for it. As a contract could either be ACTIVE meaning it's not yet cancelled and still active, CANCELLED OR EXPIRED which means the contract is no longer active and was cancelled, and POSTPONED which means the contract was signed, but no payments are made until the client decides to unfreeze the contract and start paying (we sometimes refer to a postponed contract as a freeze agreement or a freeze contract)
-Column D: titled: ClientName
This column also exists to be an indicator on who the contract is signed with, so it's the name of the client that the contract was signed with. This column isn't unique, since multiple contracts could be signed by the same client.
It’s possible that this column would contain NULL values as those are the clients we weren’t able to gather their name before signing.
-Column E: titled: ClientNationality
This column shows us the nationality of the client that the contract was signed with. This column will sometimes contain a NULL value because we might not have access to the client's nationality so we didn't add it.
An important thing to note here is that the values are written as nationalities, not by the name of the country.

-Column F: titled: FirstHousemaidName
Since our company is a maid's company, every contract should have a maid attached to it, and this column exists to give us the FIRST maid that was attached to the contract.
The reason why the word FIRST is included is because CC clients (And some MV clients that used to be referred to as AE) have the option to replace their maid. So when we look at the maid names present in this column, it's important to note that this is the first maid attached to the contract. For some contracts, the value here might be NULL because we couldn't get the maid's name, BUT that doesn't mean that no maid is attached to the contract.

Please note that the NULL value is not a name AND the value * is also not a name but a placeholder. So if i ask you to get me a name from this column, don’t return the Null or * values.


 -Column G: titled: isTrained
This column tells us if the first maid was trained or not (Yes/No)
-Column H: titled: TrainingDate
This column tells us if the date the first maid was trained. NULL value here means the maid wasn't trained.
-Column I: titled: FirstHousemaidisReplaced
Since we've established that maids attached to CC contracts (And some MV contracts that used to be referred to as AE) can be replaced, this column exists to tell us if the first maid was replaced or not. A NULL value here means the first housemaid wasn't replaced.
An important note here is that we DO NOT count Ethiopians with other African countries. Instead we keep them in their own category because they are the maids who are Arabic speakers in our company.
If the maid is replaced, the value will be “isReplaced”
If not, it will be left blank (null)


Also, the values are written as nationalities, not as the name of the country. I'll share with you a list of all the nationalities that we have grouped by the category they represent:

-Column AK: titled: isLiveOut
A CC contract can be of two types, either Live-out (Liveout or Live out) or Live-in (Livein or live in)
We can know what the CC contract type is by checking the value present on this column.
If the value is TRUE it means the contract is Live-out
If the value is FALSE it’s Live-in

Also keep in mind that only CC contracts can be referred to as Live-in or Live-out

The capitalization of any letter in any of the values present in any of the mentioned columns doesn’t have any significance and it mustn’t be an obstacle when retrieving information. 

A switch to MV contract or a switching to MV contract or a Converting to MV contract or a CC to MV contract is an MV contract that has the TypeBreakdown of "CC to MV"
The “CC to MV” indicates that a client has terminated a CC contract in order to sign a new MV contract, and when the CC contract is cancelled, the reasonfortermination of the CC contract will be "Converting to maidvisa"

The Date Time format is: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS like this example: 2024-07-25 14:35:10

The user might ask for new clients, in this case, we consider a client as new if they have 1 contract within the date range the user requested, AND doesn’t have a contract signed prior to the requested date range. If the client has a contract signed after the requested date range, it is still considered a new client.

Here are some examples to help you understand better
Ex: a client who has a contract in february 2024 and a contract in june 2024 is a new client in february but not a new client in june.
Ex: A client who has two contracts in February is still a new client in February because both of his contracts were signed in the same date range.
Ex: A client who had a contract in January 2023 and a contract in January 2024 is an old client in January 2024
